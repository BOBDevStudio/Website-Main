The BOB Development Studio is a group on Roblox which among other things is used by BOB (the owner of the group) to host games he's made. The BOB Development Studio was created in December of 2020 only a few days before the year ended. The group currently hosts 2 games 1 of which is actively maintained.

# Games

As mentioned before the group currently hosts 2 games and 1 of which is actively maintained.

## Actively Maintained

### [Random Buildings And Parts]({{- "/rbap" | relative_url -}})

Random Buildings And Parts (or RBAP for short) is a Roblox game exclusively made by BOB and is used by him to showcase stuff he's made. It is his oldest project that he still maintains to this day as it has been in active production since late 2018. RBAP also has its own website (and wiki) which is accessible at [rbap.bobdevstudio.org]({{- "/rbap" | relative_url -}}).

## Occasionally Maintained

### [Techtation]({{- "/techtation" | relative_url -}})

Techtation is a Roblox game that features a simple, futuristic, and semi-realistic train station made by BOB. It only occasionally received updates which do not (usually) add new content to the game. Even though it doesn't get frequent updates it is still considered maintained due to the fact that if a bug pops up that breaks the game BOB will probably be willing to fix it. This game does not currently have its own website but BOB has been throwing around ideas of making one for it.

## Unmaintained
